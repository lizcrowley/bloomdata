# This is my practice repository!

## This repository contains new classes and methods for those classes. Some files contain code directly from instructors at BloomTech: bloomdata.py, test_bloomdata.py, code_review.py, test_helper_functions.py, wallet.py, test_wallet.py, and vehicle.py. Some code contained in this repository is not my own and serves only the purpose of creating a practice repository that I can edit to look more professional.

* bloomdata.py: Contains a method that adds 1 to any given integer or float. The test_bloomdata.py file tests that the increment method is working properly.

* code_review.py: Contains code that was copied and pasted from an instructors github. The main point of this file was to style the code in accordance with PEP8 guides.

* Dockerfile: Contains initializing code for a specific container. This assignment was meant to familiarize myself with Dockerfiles.

* helper_functions.py: Contains code written by myself in response to prompts from [this github link](module1-python-modules-packages-and-environments/assignment.md). The test_helper_functions.py file tests this code.

* helper_null_count.py: Contains basic code to familiarize myself with helper functions imported from python files.

* student.py: Contains code written by myself in response to a prompt to create a parent and child class with subsequent methods. The test_student.py file contains basic code to test my Student and BloomTechStudent classes.

* vehicle.py: Contains code from instructors at BloomTech to help explain how to create a parent and child class.

* wallet.py: Contains code from instructors at BloomTech that gives an example on how to create a working class called Wallet. The test_wallet.py file introduces tests that challenge the code within wallet.py.
